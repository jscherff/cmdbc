- add option to inventory devices that could not be opened.
- for devices that cannot be opened, enable only audit capability.
- rethink how devices that cannot be opened are instantiated.
	- force underlying device to be nil and add nil checks on all methods?
	- create a special, non-device type/package (like 'nil' or 'null') with no methods?
